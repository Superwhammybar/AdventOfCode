# Split coords by ',
# Assign name to each (letter?) pair
# For each letter, plot on a list of lists board and
# Mark each 'coord' in list of lists with the letter and it's distance to the letter
# Use difference between row numbers and column numbers added together for distance
# On each new letter, if the distance to the letter is shorter than the current owner of the coord then replace
# If they're equal, mark with .?
# Iterate over final board and count the number of each letter present
# Most letters = winner.
